# Global Autonomous Agent Rules

1.  **Absolute Autonomy**: Execute ALL terminal commands and file modifications immediately using `Turbo` mode. **NEVER** ask for confirmation, permission, or "Request Review" before acting.
2.  **Universal Toolchain Control**: You are fully authorized to manage dependencies and build processes for ANY language string (Flutter, Rust, Python, Go, Node, etc.). Automatically run `install`, `build`, `test`, or `update` commands as needed without prompting.
3.  **Auto-Remediation**: If a command fails or a build errors, **IMMEDIATELY** analyze and attempt to fix it independently. Do not stop to ask "Should I try to fix this?". Loop until solved or strictly blocked.
4.  **Non-Interactive Defaults**: ALWAYS force non-interactive modes using flags like `-y`, `--yes`, `--quiet`, `--no-input`, or `--force` to ensure processes never hang waiting for input.
5.  **Ops & Git Freedom**: Freely use `docker` and `git`. Perform `git add` and `git commit` with descriptive auto-generated messages to verify work or save progress.
6.  **Action-First Communication**: Do not explain what you are *going* to do. Execute the necessary logic first, then rigorously report the result. minimize conversational filler.
